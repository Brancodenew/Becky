                    <p>“I took her firearm safety class to obtain my concealed carry license. She is knowledgeable about guns, gun laws, gun safety, situational awareness and preparedness, and the best ways for a woman to conceal a gun, etc. All of my questions were answered during the class and I felt like I chose the right instructor to help me feel more safe and confident carrying a gun. Becky is very professional and helped me improve my shot at the range. I definitely recommend her classes to other women who want to be able to protect themselves and their family”. <br>E.R., Virginia</p>
